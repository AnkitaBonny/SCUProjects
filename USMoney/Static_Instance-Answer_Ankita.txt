Q) The above 2 methods are to be written as static methods. Do you see any reason to define them as instance methods, instead?  Give your reasons as to why you think they should be instance (or static method).Answer:  I think both the method should be static. As those two methods doesn’t describe the behavior or characteristics of the class. It’s like utility method, and it’s not supposed to change. And it makes complete sense to call that method even if no object has been constructed. Those methods are not using any instance variable. Any operation on those methods are not dependent on instance creation.
