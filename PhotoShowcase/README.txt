Note:
1. I have attached photo folder with this assignment. To run the application please save photo folder anywhere in your computer to access pictures( resized according to app).

On click of “ Add photo to Collection” button it redirects to current directory of system , from there any photo can be accessed. As app does not resize photo within application so some resized photo is already given to “photo” folder
